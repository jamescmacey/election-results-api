# election-results-api
This Django project serves as the backend for [jamescmacey/byelection-results](https://github.com/jamescmacey/byelection-results), relaying results stored in MongoDB to the client.

Like the frontend, it is also hardcoded for the Tauranga by-election, but future updates for the 2023 General Election (and possible 2022 Rongotai by-election, if it happens as predicted) will change this.

Another option may be to have the backend entirely based in MongoDB using Atlas App Services; this will need to be investigated.
